## Project Description

This project analyzes weekly U.S. unemployment insurance initial claims rates using time series regression methods. The goal is to model temporal dependence, examine lagged relationships, and assess the impact of unusual economic periods using statistically appropriate techniques covered in Math 261A.

The analysis emphasizes interpretability, correct model specification, and reproducibility.

This dataset is publicly available through the California Open Data Portal and is maintained by a U.S. state government agency.

# Dataset License and Usage

The dataset is provided as part of the California Open Data initiative and is intended for public use, transparency, research, and educational purposes. Data published on the California Open Data Portal are generally made available without restriction for public, non-commercial, and academic use.

The dataset is used in this project solely for academic coursework and educational analysis, in accordance with the California Open Data usage guidelines.

# Use of LLMs
External resources, including Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, were used responsibly and in a limited capacity during this project.

Specifically, LLMs were used for:
- Spelling, grammar, and clarity checks in written explanations
- Minor code debugging and formatting assistance

All primary ideas, modeling decisions, analytical direction, and interpretation of results were developed independently by the author based on coursework knowledge from Math 261A and Math 265. No external tools were used to design models, select methods, perform statistical inference, or draw substantive conclusions.

The use of LLMs was strictly supportive and did not replace independent statistical reasoning or course-based understanding.
